bookmark-manager
================

This was a pair programming project completed by myself and csharpd during week 6 of Makers Academy

Bookmark manager is an application which allows users to save and tag web links which they want to keep. Users can log in, log out and reset passwords, and can filter their list of links by tags.

The aim of this project was to learn about integration testing, relational databases, and web application security.

It is a sinatra application, built using Ruby, PSQL, Datamapper and BCrypt, and tested with RSPEC and Capybara.
